# The trading halts manipulation led by stock mortgage--an example in A share market crash

This is my paper for graduation during my study as an undergraduate in Sun Yat-sen University, Lingnan (College) School. I mainly used Stata to complete this paper. Data were from CSMAR and Wind databases.

##[Abstract]

This paper studied the “tide of trading halts” during the A share market crash in 2015, and raised the hypothesis that the shareholders of listed companies have the incentive to manipulate trading halts in order to avoid the margin call and the liquidation. Using kernel density curves and mean difference test to analyze the panel data of the whole year, we confirmed that the stock price-mortgage ratio of halting companies is significantly lower than those who don’t halt. This paper considered this tide of trading halts as partial circuit-breaking. Further analysis is conducted from the views of system deficiency, policies interpretation and long-term risk spread. The conclusions of this paper can be summarized as followed: (1) The stock mortgage and the deficiency of trading halts system is an important reason to this tide of trading halts. Halts might not allow the listed companies to dodge the market crash ,but definitely led to a great sacrifice of market liquidity. (2) In the long-run, the bailout policies made the stock mortgage lost its risk controlling function, and further weaken the resources allocation efficiency of the financial market.
